Sick of having 20 different furniture mods? Well this mods goal is to have one furniture & clutter decoration mod with all your needs satisfied.

This mod currently adds 2 different table types to the game with variants of every wood, log, and stripped log type! I will be working hard to add many more furniture and decoration items. 

**Why another furniture mod?** I got tired of installing 20 different furniture mods that have crafting recipe conflicts just to have good looking decorations! So I decided to make one mod with decorations inspried by those mods to get rid of conflicts and missing items.

**TODO**:
- More fancy tables
- Shelves
- Sofas
- Chairs
- Carpets
- Cabinets
- & more!
